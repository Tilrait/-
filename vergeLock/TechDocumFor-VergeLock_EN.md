# VergeLock

**VergeLock** is an RTS project with elements of role-playing progression, crafting, and competitive modes, designed for session-based PvP battles between teams of players.
The main focus is not on mass unit production, but on individual control of a superhero and a limited, yet specialized squad that adapts to the owner's playstyle.

The project combines the tactical depth of RTS, the personalization of RPG, and the competitive dynamics of matchmaking, creating a balanced gameplay loop where victory depends not on quantity, but on the quality of decisions.
